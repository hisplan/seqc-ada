## How to Develop Analysis Notebook

Enter into the Jupyter Notebook container:

```bash
./run-notebook.sh
```

When you get a prompt back, activate the conda virtual environment called `workspace` and then launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
conda activate workspace
jupyter notebook --allow-root
```

Duplicate the existing analysis notebook and work on a new version.
